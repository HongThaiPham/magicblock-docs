## Why Use a Local Setup?

When testng delegations and real-time behaviour of your Solana programs, fast feedback loops may be critical.

Running an **Local Ephemeral Rollup** allows you to:

- Test delegations and behaviours quickly without network latency and rate limits.
- Simulate real-time Solana runtime transactions locally.
- Customize your local ephemeral validator to your needs.

---

## Quickstart Local Ephemeral Validator

Install the latest version of validator to your localhost:

```bash
npm install -g @magicblock-labs/ephemeral-validator@latest
```

Start the validator locally (pointing to devnet):

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ephemeral-validator --accounts-lifecycle ephemeral --remote-url "https://rpc.magicblock.app/devnet"
```

Find customization options for your validator such as rpc port:

```bash
ephemeral-validator -h
```
