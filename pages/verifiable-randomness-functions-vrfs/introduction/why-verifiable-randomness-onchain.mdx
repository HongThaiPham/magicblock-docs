title: "Why Verifiable Onchain Randomness?"
description: "Verifiable randomness ensures that random outcomes in decentralized applications are **fair, transparent, and tamper-proof**"
---

**Traditional offchain randomness** suffers from:

- **Lack of transparency** – Users cannot verify how random numbers are generated.
- **Manipulation risks** – Developers, miners, or validators could influence outcomes for financial gain.
- **Delayed or unreliable delivery** – offchain randomness may not align with onchain execution timing.

**Verifiable onchain randomness** solves these challenges by providing:

- ✅ **Cryptographic verification** – Randomness results are proven and validated onchain.
- ✅ **Fairness and trustlessness** – No single party can manipulate outcomes.
- ✅ **Full transparency** – Every random value can be audited directly on the blockchain.
- ✅ **Instant availability** – Randomness is delivered onchain within seconds, ready for use in smart contracts.

MagicBlock exposes this capability through **EphemeralVrf** – a Solana VRF implementation that uses a network of oracles to compute and verify random values. The protocol follows [RFC&nbsp;9381](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9381), leveraging Curve25519's Ristretto group and Schnorr‑style signatures for proofs. See the [Technical Details](./technical-details) page for integration specifics.

#### Example use cases

- Provably fair loot boxes or chest drops
- Secure gacha systems
- Randomized spawn or resource generation
- Chain-verified PvP matchmaking
- Trustless raffles or giveaways
