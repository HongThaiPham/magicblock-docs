> `Delegation` is the process of transferring ownership of one or more of your program's `PDAs` to the delegation program. Ephemeral Validators will then be able to use the `PDAs` to perform transactions in the SVM runtime.

> `Commit` is the process of updating the state of the `PDAs` from ER to the base layer. After the finalization process, the `PDAs` remain locked on base layer.

> `Undelegation` is the process of transferring ownership of the `PDAs` back to your program. On undelegation, the state is committed and it trigger the finalization process. Once state it validated, the `PDAs` are unlocked and can be used as normal on base layer.
